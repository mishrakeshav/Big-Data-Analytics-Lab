# Frequent-Itemset-Mining
Implementation of Apriori Algorithm using MapReduce.

Apriori algorithm is the basic algorithm for finding frequent itemsets. It is one of the methods for mining the frequent patterns such as for market basket analysis. Frequent itemset mining leads to the discovery of associations and correlations among items in large transactional or relational datasets. This information can lead to increased sales by helping retailers do selective marketing and plan their shelf space.
